\paragraph{Irregularity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item adaptation potential: essentially, butting up against structural restrictions of genotype mapping (i.e. regularity)
    \item ``During the development of a complex system some parts may already be (close-to) optimal in the current state, while other parts have to adapt further to specific demands or changing conditions... A representation that can only change both targets simultaneously is counterproductive.'' \cite{Richter2015EvolvabilitySurvey}
    \item ``HybrID that allows the HyperNEAT indirect encoding to produce regular patterns in concert with a direct encoding that can modify these patterns to produce irregularities. HybrID matches HyperNEATâ€™s performance on regular problems, but outperforms HyperNEAT on problems with irregularity, which demonstrates that HyperNEAT struggles to generate certain kinds of irregularity on its own. The success of HybrID raises the interesting question of whether indirect encodings may truly excel not as stand-alone algorithms, but in combination with a further process that refines their regular patterns'' \cite{Clune2011OnRegularity}

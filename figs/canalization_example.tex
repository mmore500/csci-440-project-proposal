  \caption{This cartoon depicts an artificial selection experiment on \textit{Drosophilia melangoster}. In treatment i, selection is made for a bilaterally symmetric trait -- overall decreased eye size. Because this bilaterally symmetric trait can be produced through heritable variation, artificial selection succeeds. In treatment ii, artificial selection for a non-bilaterally symmetric trait -- relatively smaller right eye size -- fails because (due to the development process of \textit{Drosophilia}), heritable variation that produces this trait is not readily attainable \cite{Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment}}.
